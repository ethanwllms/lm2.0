        <p>
          Inspired to get a start in development after encountering interactive museum exhibits, I'm growing my passion for puzzle solving, brainstorming, and outside of the box thinking as an Apprentice Front-end Developer + UX/UI Designer at Nashville Software School. 
          I'm excited to bring my unique background to the development world where I plan to make my mark with innovative thinking and motivation to tackle even the most unthinkable projects.
